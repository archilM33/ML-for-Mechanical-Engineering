# ML-for-Mechanical-Engineering
To gain strong hands-on experience with core machine learning algorithms, I worked extensively with models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression, applying them to practical datasets for classification and prediction tasks. Throughout this process, I utilized Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for efficient data handling, preprocessing, and visualization, enabling clear insights into data trends and model behavior. Building on this foundation, I extended my understanding to the financial domain by implementing advanced models such as the Binomial Pricing model and the Black-Scholes formula, significantly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of option valuation while gaining a deeper appreciation for the intersection of machine learning and quantitative finance.
